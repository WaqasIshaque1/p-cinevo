## Before you start!
Before starting a contribution, please make your contribution is part of an open issue on [our issues page](https://github.com/movie-web/movie-web/issues). 

GitHub issues are how we track our bugs and feature requests that will be implemented into movie-web - all contributions **must** have an issue and be approved by a maintainer before a pull request can be worked on.

> :warning: The exception to this are language contributions, which are discussed in [this section](#language-contributions)

Also, make sure that the issue you would like to work on has not been got the "awaiting-approval" label by a maintainer. Otherwise, if we reject the issue it means your work will have gone to waste!

 - GitHub Issues
